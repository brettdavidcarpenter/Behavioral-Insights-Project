# Behavioral-Insights-Project
Analysis of behavioral policy implementation

This is a public policy data analysis project I did in R as a part of a quantitative skills assesment. 

The project asks us to determine the effect of a given policy change on the rate of failure to appear in court. Using statistical analysis, I attempt to measure the effectiveness of a proposed policy change that was introduced via RCT (Randomized control trial).

I also analyze how the new policy may adversely affect a variety of demographics to ensure that no single group is disadvanteaged by the change.

The instructions for this project are in problem-overview.pdf
